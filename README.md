## Sorting and Searching

Sorting and searching are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in optimizing various algorithms. They are widely used in data processing, databases, searching algorithms, and real-world applications like ranking systems, recommendation engines, and route planning.

## Sorting
Sorting refers to arranging data in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. It helps in efficient searching, data analysis, and enhances the performance of other algorithms.
### Types of Sorting Algorithms
#### Comparison-based Sorting
These algorithms compare elements to determine their order.

1. Bubble Sort (O(n²)) – Simple but inefficient for large data.
2. Selection Sort (O(n²)) – Selects the smallest element and places it in the correct position.
3. Insertion Sort (O(n²)) – Inserts elements into their correct position one by one.
4. Merge Sort (O(n log n)) – Uses the divide and conquer approach.
5. Quick Sort (O(n log n)) – Selects a pivot and partitions elements around it.
6. Heap Sort (O(n log n)) – Uses a binary heap for sorting.

### Non-comparison-based Sorting
These algorithms do not compare elements directly.

1. Counting Sort (O(n + k)) – Works well for small integer ranges.
2. Radix Sort (O(nk)) – Sorts numbers digit by digit.
3. Bucket Sort (O(n + k)) – Divides elements into buckets and sorts them.

## Searching
Searching refers to finding an element in a data structure like an array, linked list, or tree.

### Types of Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search (O(n)) :
- Scans elements one by one.
- Used when data is unsorted or small.
- Example: Searching for a name in an unsorted list.

3. Binary Search (O(log n))
- Requires sorted data.
- Uses a divide and conquer approach.
- Example: Finding a number in a sorted list.
